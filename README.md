# Supervised Learning Algorithms in Python

### 1. [K - Nearest Neighbour](https://github.com/sourcecode369/supervised-learning-algorithms/tree/master/K%20Nearest%20Neighbours)
> In this repository, we are first going to implement the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. 
It’s extremely simple and intuitive, and it’s a great first classification algorithm to learn. 
We’ll look at some ways in which KNN can fail.
It’s important to know both the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm we look at.

### 2. [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/sourcecode369/supervised-learning-algorithms/tree/master/Naive-Bayes)
> Next we’ll look at the Naive Bayes Classifier and the General Bayes Classifier. This is a very 
interesting algorithm to look at because it is grounded in probability.
We’ll see how we can transform the Bayes Classifier into a linear and quadratic 
classifier to speed up our calculations.

### 3. [Decision Tree Classifier](https://github.com/sourcecode369/supervised-learning-algorithms/tree/master/Decision%20Tree%20Classifier)
> Next we’ll look at the famous Decision Tree algorithm. 
This is the most complex of the algorithms we’ll implement and its important
to lay the foundation of one of the most powerful class of algorithms called Ensemble Algorithms.

### 4. [Perceptrons](https://github.com/sourcecode369/supervised-learning-algorithms/tree/master/Perceptrons)
> The last algorithm we’ll look at is the Perceptron algorithm. Perceptrons are the ancestor of 
neural networks and deep learning, so they are important to study in the context of machine learning.

### 5.[Practical Machine Learning](https://github.com/sourcecode369/supervised-learning-algorithms/tree/master)
> One we’ve studied these algorithms, we’ll move to more practical machine learning topics. 
**Hyperparameters**, **cross-validation**, **feature extraction**, **feature selection**, and **multiclass classification**.

We’ll discuss the Sci-Kit Learn library, because even though implementing your own algorithms 
is fun and educational, you should use optimized and well-tested code in your actual work.

### 6. [Final Project - Creating a Web Service](https://github.com/sourcecode369/supervised-learning-algorithms/tree/master)
> We’ll cap things off with a very practical, real-world example by writing a web service that 
runs a machine learning model and makes predictions. This is something that real companies do and make money from.
